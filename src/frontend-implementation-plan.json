      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When viewing the Number Matrix puzzle, the overall grid area behind/between cells renders with a blue background.",
        "Cells that are prefilled/disabled (data.given[row][col] === true) render with a light orange background.",
        "Cells that are editable (data.given[row][col] === false) render with a slightly darker orange background.",
        "Both prefilled and user-entered digits render in black text.",
        "These color updates apply only to the Number Matrix grid and do not unintentionally change styling of other puzzle types or general app components."

          "description": "Adjust Tailwind classes in the Number Matrix grid wrapper and per-cell Input className: add a blue background (with padding/rounding as needed) to the grid container so gaps/border area show blue; set given cells to a light orange background and editable cells to a slightly darker orange background; force all digits to render in black (including disabled/given cells) by applying text-black and overriding disabled text/opacity styling locally. Ensure changes are scoped to this renderer only and do not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui."
